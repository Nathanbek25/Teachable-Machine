      <p>The goal of this project was to create a machine learning AI that could hear what number you would say and display what number it was on the screen. Originally it was going to understand between two different languages but there are many problems with that. Overall I am happy with the project that I have created even if there are some errors in what numbers the AI thinks is being said. </p>
